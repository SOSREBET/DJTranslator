## Introduction

The purpose of creating this script is to automate the translation of django replicas through Google Translate **without an API**. You can customize / edit the code for yourself.

The script is based on selenium 4.8 and python 3.9.

## Main features

- Selenium + fake-useragent
- Google Translate without API
- Chromedriver
- PEP8
- Multiprocessing mode
- Save python formatting strings
- Save classes of html strings

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository from Github and switch to the new directory:

```bash
(venv) foo@bar:~$ git clone https://github.com/SOSREBET/DJTransaltor
(venv) foo@bar:~$ cd DJTranslator/
```

2. Download the appropriate [version](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) of chromedriver for your Chrome and extract it in DJTranslator.
   
3. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
foo@bar:~/DJTranslator$ python3.9 -m venv venv
foo@bar:~/DJTranslator$ source venv/bin/activate
```

4. Install project dependencies:
   
```bash
(venv) foo@bar:~/DJTranslator$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Translation is done using manger.<br>
The manager takes the following arguments:

- codes: Language codes
- driver_path: Path to chromedriver
- locale_path: Path to locale folder
- headless: Windowless Mode
- multi: Multiprocessor mode
- multi_max: Maximum number of processes
- lang_interface: Language (code) in which GT will be opened
- from_lang: Language code from which the translation will be carried out
- retry: Attempts to translate

<br>

If your GT does not have time to translate, you can increase the first value (1.8) and the second (2.1) in random_pause.

### *My unsuccessful attempts to improve the script*

1. Run entire script via Class:<br>
   I tried to implement a single Class, but driverChrome is non-serializable, as a result of which multiprocessing stops working.
2. Implement large line breaks django.po:<br>
   It was possible to implement these transfers, but because of this, the stability and quality of the translation deteriorated. I've tried different ways, and in the end I can say this: if you really need hyphens, try to implement them through the maximum length of the line.
